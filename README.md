An Anki deck for learning Spanish castellano as used in mainland Spain. This is a continuously evolving deck.

# Requirements
This deck uses the [anki-language-learning-note](https://gitlab.com/evolverine/anki-language-learning-note), and one of the implications is that the desktop client of Anki cannot render them yet (as they use JavaScript).

To import this deck you will need [the CrowdAnki addon](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1788670778).

# Collaboration
The main goal of this deck is to be continually improved by learners. For this to be possible, though, one currently needs a working understanding and knowledge of [the git versioning system](https://git-scm.com/). If that is the case, make sure you've installed it, and then install [CrowdAnki](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1788670778).

## Way of working

* make as small commits as possible. Ideally one commit for each changed note. (Admittedly I have yet to start following this rule, but once collaboration starts to happen it will be very important.)
* specify, whenever possible, the source of the changes - was it a native speaker (from which country / region?) who recommended it, was it a dictionary (which?), an online forum (which?), etc.

### Conventions

* all nouns come with their article ("the" in English, and "el/la" in Spanish)
* nouns can be requested and learned in both their masculine and feminine forms, and, if desired, both in their singular and plural forms. This is useful when these forms are not standard in some way. When using the two genders, tag the note with "indication_2_genders_learned", and when representing both the singular and plural forms, use the tag "indication_singular_plural_learned".
* when it is unclear which meaning of the word / phrase you want remembered, you have two options:
** the gamut of "clarification_" tags, which display a visual indication specifying that the word is an adjective, adverb, preposition, (transitive) verb, or a specific concept such as a color or a number. The last one is "clarification_expression", which indicates that a single word may exist, but that in this note one expects an expression instead.
** using contexts
